# Intro

Hi! Iâ€™m @hubsibad as you can tell. Currently this github account is not really being utilised so I'm not sure how you would have found me unless you went digging for this in which case, nice job!
I plan to practice C# with the .NET framework, if you happen to be comfortable with VS and developing in general, I'll appreciate any tips to pick up on!

Cool picture (if you know, you know!)
